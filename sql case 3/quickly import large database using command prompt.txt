Steps to Import LARGE table(s) into MySQL Database QUICKLY
/*Load large CSV files into MySQL Datbase faster using Command line prompt
1. Open MySQL Workbench, Create a new database to store the tables you'll import (eg- FacilitySerivces).
Then, Create the table with matching data types of csv file, usually with INT and CHAR datatypes only (without the data) in the database you just created using Workbench.
2. Open the terminal or command line prompt (Go to windows, search for cmd.exe. Shortcut - Windows button + R, then type cmd)
3. We'll now connect with MySQL database in command line prompt. Follow the steps below:
Copy the path of your MySQL bin directory in your computer. (Normally it is under c drive program files).
The bin directory of MySQL Server is generally in this path - C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
Now, in the Command Line prompt, type cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin and press enter.
4. Connect to the MySQL database using the following command in command line prompt
mysql -u root -p
(please replace root with your user name that you must have confirgured while installing MySQL server)
(press enter, it will ask for the password, give your password)
5. If you are successfully logged to mysql,
then set the global variables by using below command so that data can be imported from local computer folder.
mysql> SET GLOBAL local_infile=1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
(you've just instructed MySQL server to allow local file upload from your computer)

6. Quit current server connection:
mysql> quit
Bye

7. Load the file from CSV file to the MySQL database. In order to do this, please follow the commands:
(We'll connect with the MySQL server again with the local-infile system variable. This basically means you want to upload data into a file from a local machine)

- mysql --local-infile=1 -u root -p
(give password)

- Show Databases;
(It'll show all the databases in MySQL server.)

- mysql> USE fs_db2;
(makes the database that you had created in step 1 as default schema to use for the next sql scripts)
(Use your Database and load the file into the table.
The next step is to load the data from local case study folder into the transactionmaster table in fs_db2 database)

- mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\IVY\\sql case 3\\TransactionMaster.csv'
INTO TABLE transactionmaster
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n' IGNORE 1 ROWS;

*VERY IMP - Please replace single backward (\) slash in the path with double back slashes (\\) instead of single slash*
Also note that "transactionmaster" is my table name, use the table name that you've given while creating the database.

8. Now check if data has been imported or not.

SELECT * FROM transactionmaster LIMIT 20;

9. If data has been imported successfully with 100% accuracy without error,
then alter the table to update the datatypes, etc. You're all set now.
